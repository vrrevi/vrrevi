**Hi thereüôåüèæ**  
I'm Revathi, a Technical Writer based out of London. I have been a Technical Writer for more than 5 years.
This repository has some of my writing samples I created at work and also personal projects that I experimented with.

## Writing samples from work

### Technical Blog Articles
This article was written in WordPress as part of my freelance work. I collaborated with the developers, understood the product suite, and drafted the document. The final draft was reviewed for technical correctness, writing style, and tone of the company.

   - [Why automating code quality is an ROI for the business?](https://github.com/vrrevi/vrrevi/blob/main/Technical%20articles/Why%20automating%20code%20quality%20is%20an%20ROI%20for%20the%20business.md)
   
### FAQ Document
This document was created in my work. It addressed the frequent calls to the Support Team. I have changed the product names.
