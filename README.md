**Hi thereüôåüèæ**

Thanks for viewing my technical writing portfolio.
This repository has some of my writing samples I created at work and also personal projects that I experimented with.

## Writing samples from work

### Technical Blog Article
This article was written in WordPress as part of my freelance work for Integral Zone. I collaborated with the developers, understood the IZ product suite, and drafted the document. The final draft was reviewed for technical correctness, writing style, and tone of IZ.

### FAQ Document
This document was created for field representatives who use the IvyRep mobile app for their day-to-day activities. This FAQ addressed the frequent calls to the Support Team.
