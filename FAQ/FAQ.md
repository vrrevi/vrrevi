1. **My Dashboard is not displaying the KPIs for the month. What's wrong?**

    If you don't synchronize master data to the backend server, KPIs don't appear on the monthly dashboard. Before you close the day on your app, upload the transaction data. Before you start your day, download the latest master data to get the updated KPIs.

3. **Why visit plan shows doctors that are out of my route?**

   Please contact your Area Sales Manager (ASM) to reset your visit plan. The ASMs configure the visit plans on the backend portal every month.

4. **The app is not letting me submit my Monthly plan for my Manager review.**

    The Monthly Tour Plans must be submitted before the last day of the month. If you miss the deadline, the app auto-submits the previous month's plan. Contact your Manager to unlock the plan for submission.

5. **My Stockist says no samples are available for distribution. Who should I contact now?**

    Stockists replenish samples every two weeks. You can select 'No samples for distribution' option on your app to let your line Manager know.
