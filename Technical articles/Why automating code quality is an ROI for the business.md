# Why automating code quality is an ROI for the business?
## IZ Analyzer for Mulesoft and APIs
With businesses undergoing digital transformation at a never before rate, demand for enterprise software is at an all-time high. Due to the competitive market and high demand, low development effort and faster time-to-market are prioritized over product quality.


Ignoring quality issues within the code base will result in the waste of entire developmental effort and budget. In many cases, due to stringent timelines and market needs, products are given go-ahead despite the poor quality source code.
In most cases, developers are not adept with latest advancements along with the lack of centralized testing techniques within the organization.


As a pre-cursor to avoid code quality issues, code reviews or automated testing can be implemented. However, these techniques only check the code against a set of pre-defined rules. Traditional code review methods often fail to detect bugs in the source code – during the initial design stage.



Today, companies prefer to invest in enterprise-grade applications that efficiently implement controls and procedures throughout the organization. Various third-party tools, APIs, plug-ins are integrated to develop an enterprise level product. Quality/security issues in such products will add to the complexities. For example, in an enterprise integrated set-up like Mulesoft applications where integrations are used as re-usable building blocks, identifying bugs at later stages affects the entire business process. All these issues require companies to look for modern automated code quality review tools that detect bugs, vulnerabilities earlier even before they cause disruptions to the development cycle.

There are many enterprise-level code scanning tools like SonarQube, DeepAnalyzer available in the market. They provide complete code review, detect bug risks and anti-patterns but their ability to scale across platforms remains a serious limitation. Only a handful of tools can define code quality automation, cover RAML, JSON, and XML-based configuration files and work along hybrid integration suites. This is where Integral Zone’s IZ Analyzer comes into the picture.

IZ Analyzer is an enhanced sonar based tool that covers hybrid integration suite like mule. It efficiently scrutinizes the integration and only integrations without vulnerability/security issues pass through the quality gates. As the entire source code is analyzed with plugins, the entire process from design to deployment is bug-free. IZ Analyzer offers cloud components including – IZ Mule Analyzer, IZ Studio Analyzer and IZ API Analyzer.
